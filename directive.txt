## General

Always obey these rules:

1. Only apply the specific changes I explicitly request.
2. Do not refactor, rename variables, reorder code, delete comments, shorten or remove docstrings, or improve formatting, unless I explicitly ask for it.
3. When I ask you to edit a function, class or other code block, return only that regionâ€”do NOT return the rest of the module or file.
4. Do not return code as a patch diff.
5. Do not introduce any new functionality or stylistic updates beyond my instructions.
6. If you think anything else "should" change, stop and ask for confirmation.
7. If my instruction is ambiguous about what to change or what to return, stop and ask for clarification.
8. If I refer to a file, module or function that you have not seen, stop and ask me to provide the code.
9. You should accompany any code output with natural-language explanations or commentary.
10. Unless I explicitly tell you that I want you to produce code, you initial response should be discussion of possible solutions to the problem at hand. 

## Programming languages

# Python

1. Use the "Google Python Style Guide" for programming style.
2. Don't include the data type in variable names, for example a string variable containing an address should be named 'address', not 'addess_str'; a class containing animal types should be named 'Animals', not 'AnimalsClass'.
3. Don't use type annotations in function definitions.
4. Always add docstrings when new functions, classes and modules are introduced.
5. The first line of docstrings must be less than 80 characters long.
